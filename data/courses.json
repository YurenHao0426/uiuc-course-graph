Is it art's job to create the cultural myths that bind society together, or to deconstruct them? Who participates in modern and contemporary art, and who doesn't? What kinds of production should be considered art? How are specific formal strategies informed by the perspectives of different subject positions? What politics underwrite them? We will consider, and reconsider, the existing narratives about art during this period with a dual aim: first, to better understand the historical positions of the artists in question, and, second, to piece together a prehistory of the moment in which we currently find ourselves.",

Statistical prediction models based on multivariate regressions often incorporate index-representations of ENSO and other relevant variables. Accordingly, we will devote some time and exercises on methods in which these models are developed as well as tested. Dynamical models are also used for climate prediction, but require computational capability and relatively more thought in design and application. Thus, we will complete the course with a significant treatment of global models as well as regional models. Both models are based on the same basic set of equations, but typically have different applications.

Furthermore, the extraction of image features and the characterization of modality-dependent background noise can be particularly challenging in typical biomedical scenarios. In this course, several applications of statistical learning to biomedical image data will be covered in depth from first principles. Analyses will be done in Python using the Scikit-learn package and all homework assignments comprise statistical analyses of biomedical image data in real decision scenarios. Histogram transforms and the fundamental properties of image texture will be introduced and revisited throughout the course. The extraction of both low- and high-order spatial features at multiple scales will be demonstrated and employed throughout the course. Support vector machines will be introduced and applied to image classification and interpretation tasks. The random forest algorithm will be introduced and used on a number of large- and small-data tasks. Multiple linear regression will be applied to neuroimaging data and some common methods of assessing model robustness shown. Cross-validation of image-derived decisions and some common methods of assessing model robustness will be shown. Feature selection and dimensionality will be discussed in terms of diagnostic task performance. The effects of inter-feature correlation upon prediction confidence will be discussed. Principal component analysis will be described and applied to various image processing tasks. Unsupervised clustering and cluster analysis of extracted image features will be introduced.

    "description": "A generative model is a powerful way of learning any kind of data distribution using unsupervised learning and they have achieved tremendous success in recent years. In the context of biomedical imaging, generative models are being actively explored for many important and diverse applications that include image and video synthesis, representation learning and semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, text to image synthesis, image compression, super-resolution, inpainting, saliency prediction, image enhancement, style transfer and texture synthesis, and image-to-image translation. Generative models also hold great potential for regularizing inverse problems that arise in biomedical image formation. This course will provide an introduction to the use of deep neural networks for generative modeling in the context of biomedical image science. An emphasis will be placed on variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), as these are currently two of the most commonly employed and efficient approaches. The use of generative models for exploring data-acquisition designs optimizing the performance of imaging systems will also be introduced. Practical details regarding the successful training and evaluation of deep generative models using biomedical image data will introduced throughout the course. This will be reinforced via homework assignments and a final project that require hands-on training of networks facilitated by allocations of GPU time. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

The range of texts we thus characterize as \"early British literature\" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the sixth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text's moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the \"African-ness\" and \"American-ness\" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons—philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental—and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization.

Writers appearing in this course might include Washington Irving, Frederick Douglass, Edgar Allan Poe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Harriet Jacobs, Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Fanny Fern, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.

    "description": "For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing education priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debates is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. 4 graduate hours.

However, with a critical eye, we also raise the concerns - we can use digital media to prolong the life of old ways of learning, for instance, where the video-lecturing teacher, the monovocal e-textbook or the bullet-pointed PowerPoint presentation transmit facts and concepts. How can we use the affordances of networked digital media to do something different? Can we imagine learning where the knowledge that learners bring to the table is valued, where learners' knowledge repertoires are extended as they actively make new knowledge, and which build collaborative knowledge cultures? 4 graduate hours.

Theory provides a vocabulary, a set of laws or generalizations, a background literature, and a conceptual framework for any effort to plan, design, and execute a research study. There is no theory-free inquiry. This is true in the social sciences as well as the natural sciences. All research seeks to explain phenomena: a theory provides an explanation for those explanations. However, these theoretical assumptions are often implicit and unreflective. Researchers may think they have no theory, or have a theory that is so taken for granted that they don’t recognize it as an assumed theory. Much of educational research suffers from this lack of theoretical self-awareness. Like any other aspect of research, theories are falsifiable. They must stand the test of evidence – which may go against them. The goal of the class is not to identify the \"right\" or \"best\" theory, but to make the identification and selection of a theory more critical and reflective.

    "description": "Addresses the ways in which knowledge is represented, with special reference to the knowledge representations of teachers and learners. Its interdisciplinary bases are functional linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, history of ideas, media/communication studies, and ontology in computer science. The focal point of the course is the five questions about meaning posed by Cope and Kalantzis in their transpositional grammar: \"what is this about?\" (reference); \"who or what is doing this?\" (agency); \"what holds this together?\" (structure); \"how does this fit with its surroundings?\" (context); and \"what is this for?\" (interest). Along these lines of inquiry, a transpositional grammar addresses language, image, embodied action, object and space. \"Transposition\" refers to the movement across these various forms of meaning, intensified in the era of pervasively multimodal, digitally-mediated communications. Applied to education, not only does this provide a valuable heuristic to reframe literacy teaching and learning (the original impulse for the development of this grammar). It also offers an integrated account of meaning-to-learn across all subject areas, including pedagogical content knowledge and learner knowledge representations. Conceived in the broader terms of social-scientific research methods, transpositional grammar is an attempt to overcome the narrowness and logocentrism of \"the language turn\" which dominated social sciences in the twentieth century. In a practical sense, semiotics of the kind explored in this course also provides tools for reading and interpreting multimodal texts and research data. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.",

Some of the fintech sectors we will discuss include consumer finance, payments, investing and trading, cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and privacy and regulatory concerns. Because of the innovative and rapidly evolving nature of the fintech sector, this class will depend heavily on student engagement and class discussion. Students should be prepared to participate actively, and not just sit and listen to lectures. Each student will participate in two group presentations on the fintech sector, at the middle and end of the semester. A group project is due at the end of the semester, detailing a fintech startup idea, an analysis of an existing fintech business, or an analysis of a fintech sector. 4 graduate hours.

Clearly manifest throughout these politics is the role of gender, race, nation, and sexuality, as relations of power and as critical factors for social life and creative imagination. This course requires weekly written reflections on the required readings; a written midterm; and a final project, which can be either a research paper or a creative project.
